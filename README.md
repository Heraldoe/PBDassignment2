## Essay questions

## Explain the difference between JSON, XML, and HTML!

A JSON file, or JavaScript Oject Notation is a file format which uses strings to store and send data which contains an attribute-value pairs. It is used to keep data in such a way that it is human-readable. XML stands for Extensible Markup Language and is a markup language which defines a rule on how to encode data that is both human and machine readable. Lastly HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language. It is the standard markup language when creating a web page. <br>
One of the differences between JSON and XML is that just like its name, JSON is based on the JavaScript language while XML is derived from SGML which stands for the Standard Generalized Markup Language. XML is made to improve the readability as it adds extra information to plain text and also to store and show data. Unlike XML, JSON is said to be more readable as it looks more like a list instead of a nested outline like XML. It is also said that JSON is more lightweight than XML. <br>
Finally, HTML is the most different when comparing the three. If JSON and XML is used to storing and sending data, HTML is used to define how to represent the existing data. HTML will represent the structure of a web page. Instead of storing any data, it just shows how a web page would look like and how it will be rendered on a browser, this would mean that a web page would need all three JSON, XML and HTML so that it can both store and represent data.
