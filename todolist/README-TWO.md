## Describe the difference between asynchronous programming with synchronous programming.

In sychronous programming, when the user asks for a request to the application or website, the application or website will be blocked until that specific task is complete. In Asynchronous programming, the user does not have to wait until the task of information transfer is finished to see the data of the application or the website.

## When Implementing Javascript and AJAX, there is an application in the paradigms of Event-Driven Programming. Describe the reasoning for those paradigms and state some examples of its application.

In Event-Driven Programming, there is a paradigm where the flow of the program is determined by the occuring events made by the user such as clicking on buttons, mouse clicks and many more. An example of this paradigm in this assignment is the create task button where the flow of the program will change when the user clicks on the button. The reason for this is so that the program will follow the user's requests.

## Describe the implementation of asynchronous programming in AJAX.

First, I added the tag script src= "https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.6.0/jquery.min.js" to the header of base.html. After doing this, write the JQuery syntax and Ajax will then wait and respond to the user action and perform it asychronously without the page being refreshed.
